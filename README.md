## A mini project for fooling around with sass and grunt

Mini project to test the functionality of theming with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) with the help of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate compiling of SASS files to CSS and keep web server running.

Clone repo and run `npm install` to get the dependencies then fire
`grunt` to start the application. Default url `http://localhost:3000/`.

To add or change a theme go to `assets/scss/themes` and go crazy.
Which theme to use is configured in `config/config.js`.
